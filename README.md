# Augmented-Reality-Virtual-Reality
INTERACTIVE AUGMENTED REALITY APPLICATION USING ANIMAL FLASHCARDS FOR EDUCATION OF CHILDREN

## Overview
This project aims to revolutionize the learning experience for students by harnessing marker-based augmented reality (AR) technology. Through this innovative approach, traditional alphabets flashcards are transformed into dynamic 3D representations for their corresponding animal 3D model, fostering an interactive and immersive learning environment. Our primary goal is to enhance retention and understanding by integrating speech recognition capabilities, specifically employing keyword recognition from a predefined dictionary, and augmenting the platform with text-to-speech functionality. This allows students to interact with the AR flashcards through spoken commands like telling the animal name and also receiving audio feedback whether the spoken animal is correct or not.

## Key Features
### Marker-based AR Technology: 
Transforms traditional alphabets flashcards into dynamic 3D representations.
### Speech Recognition: 
Employs keyword recognition from a predefined dictionary.
### Text-to-Speech Functionality: 
Enables students to interact with AR flashcards through spoken commands and receive audio feedback.
### Personalized Learning: 
Provides tailored support and challenges to maximize learning outcomes and promote self-directed learning habits.

## Setup

### 1. Download Unity Hub and Create an Account
Download and install Unity Hub.
Create a Unity account if you don't already have one.
Open Unity Hub and log in with your Unity account credentials.

### 2. Create an Account in Vuforia Developer Engine
Go to the Vuforia Developer Portal.
Sign up for a Vuforia developer account.
Log in to the Vuforia Developer Portal.

### 3. Set the Flashcard as a Target in the Vuforia Developer Engine
In the Vuforia Developer Portal, navigate to the Target Manager.
Create a new database and add your flashcard images as targets.
Download the target database.

### 4. Integrate the Target with the 3D Model
Open Unity Hub and create a new Unity project.
Import the Vuforia SDK into your Unity project.
Add the downloaded target database to your Unity project.
Import your 3D models into the Unity project.
Link the targets to the corresponding 3D models.

### 5. Do the Necessary Configuration
Configure the AR camera in Unity to use Vuforia.
Set up the scene with the flashcard targets and 3D models.
Adjust the settings for optimal performance and user experience.

### 6. Add Speech-to-Text Recognition and Evaluation
Integrate a speech recognition API (e.g., Google Cloud Speech-to-Text) into the Unity project.
Implement the keyword recognition functionality using a predefined dictionary.
Add text-to-speech functionality to provide audio feedback.
Evaluate and test the speech recognition and text-to-speech features.

### Usage
Launch the application on a compatible device.
Point the device camera at the flashcards to see the 3D representations.
Use spoken commands to interact with the flashcards.
Listen to the audio feedback provided by the text-to-speech functionality.
Engage with the adaptive learning content and receive personalized feedback.
